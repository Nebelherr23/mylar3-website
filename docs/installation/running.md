## How to start Mylar

Depending on your version of python, and how many different versions you have installed on your machine - executing the python command itself may be different than normal. 

Typically this is either ``python`` or ``python3`` - however in some cases, ``python3.9`` or ``python39`` may also work (as an example if you had python3.9 installed, other versions you would just change out the 3.9/39 for that version). Note that this will normally coincide with the pip command above - _python3 = pip3_, _python3.9 = pip3.9_, _python = pip_, etc

From a command prompt/shell, and from within the Mylar program directory - type in ``<python executable> Mylar.py`` where _python executable_ is ``python``, ``python3``,etc as previously mentioned above
